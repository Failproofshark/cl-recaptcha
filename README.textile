h1. cl-recaptcha

cl-recaptcha is a simple interconnection between recaptcha.com and common-lisp. It can be used for the trivial usage of the recaptcha service.

h2. dependencies

cl-recaptcha require split-sequence and drakma.  I currently load it through clbuild (you'll have to add it to wnnp-projects) to handle the dependencies.

h2. usage

The simplest way to use cl-recaptcha is to get a public and private key from recaptcha.com.  Set the key in cl-recaptcha, insert the needed code in your site and ask cl-recaptcha for verification.  All this should look somewhat like this:

  (setf cl-recaptcha:*private-captcha-key* "your-private-key")
  (setf cl-recaptcha:*public-captcha-key* "your-publick-key")

In the source of the page, insert a call to challenge where you want to have your recaptcha inserted.

  (challenge)

Assuming you get your post-vars by (get-post-var "varname") and the ip of the user by (get-ip-address), you can check the validity of the entry of the user by running:

  (verify-captcha (get-post-var "recaptcha_challenge_field") (get-post-var "recaptcha_response_field") (get-ip-address))

which will return T on success and nil on failure.  The second value it returns tells you something about the reason of failure.
